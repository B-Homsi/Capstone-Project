## Description

IntelliFlash is a powerful and user-friendly spaced repetition
flashcards app designed to help you learn and retain information more
effectively. The app is built using React and Next.js, ensuring a
seamless and efficient learning experience. In IntelliFlash, you can
create subjects and topics, add flashcards, review them daily, and
track your progress.

## Demo

1. Create Subjects and Topics: Click the (+) button
   on the homepage to create a new subject, and then add topics within
   that subject. This allows you to organize your learning material based
   on your interests and needs.

   selecting a subject and clicking on the desired topic. Once there, you
   can add flashcards by clicking the (+) button on the navbar.
